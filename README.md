## Introduction
This project involves developing a data model to better understand customer loan profiles using a credit dataset. We conducted primary statistical analysis, handled missing values and outliers, and performed feature engineering.

## Modelling
We developed three machine learning models to predict the probability of loan default:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Deep Neural Network**

## Results
The Random Forest model provided the best performance, offering higher accuracy and better specificity compared to Logistic Regression and Deep Neural Network models.

## Conclusion
Our findings indicate that the Random Forest model is the most effective for predicting credit defaults, highlighting the importance of model selection in credit risk assessment.
